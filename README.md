# Eminem-lyrics-generator
This code generates Eminem-like lyrics two lines at a time

You need to download both the eminem_lyrics_generator.py file and the eminem_lyrics.txt file and put them in the same file directory

Couple sidenotes:
The code functions like it should 80% of the time, if it prints "RUINED" before the output, it means that the output is potentially really bad
The code also gives an error like 1% of the time but it's not a big deal so I didn't bother fixing it
Also the lyrics won't be perfect of course and will seldom make any sense but I think the output is pretty cool nonetheless
